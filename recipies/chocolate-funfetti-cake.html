    <h2>Discription</h2>
    <p>
      Sprinkles make everything more funâ€”and this chocolate funfetti cake proves
      it! To make the cake layers easier to frost, I recommend carefully
      wrapping them in plastic wrap, then placing them either in the fridge or
      freezer until chilled.

    <h3>Frosting</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
      <li>12 ounces full fat cream cheese, at room temperature</li>
      <li>4 1/2 cups confectioner's sugar</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoon almond extract</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons heavy cream, chilled</li>
      <li>1/3 cup rainbow jimmie sprinkles</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray 3 8-inch round
        cake pans with a baking spray containing flour, and line the bottoms of
        the pans with parchment paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        For cake, sift together flour, cocoa powder, espresso powder, baking
        soda, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, beat together butter, vegetable oil, and brown sugar on
        medium-high speed until light and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. Add in eggs 1
        at a time; beating well after each addition. Mix in vanilla. Add in half
        of the dry ingredients and mix until just combined. Add in sour cream
        and milk, and mix until just combined. Add in remaining dry ingredients
        and mix until just combined. Fold in sprinkles.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide batter evenly between pans. Gently tap pans on the counter a few
        times to remove larger air bubbles.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until tops of the cakes spring back lightly
        when touched, 30 to 35 minutes. Err on the side of slightly underbaking
        rather than overbaking. Allow cakes to cool in pans for 30 minutes
        before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
      </li>
      <li>
        For frosting, beat butter in a large bowl until smooth. Add in cream
        cheese and beat until smooth. Add in 1 cup of powdered sugar, 1 1/2
        teaspoons vanilla, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and almond extract and mix until
        smooth. Add in remaining powdered sugar 1 cup at a time, mixing well
        after each addition. Add in chilled heavy cream and beat until frosting
        is light and fluffy, about 3 minutes on medium-high speed. Fold in
        sprinkles.
      </li>
      <li>
        To assemble cake, place one cooled cake layer onto a serving platter.
        Top with a thin layer of the frosting. Continue layering and frosting
        remaining cake layers. Use remaining frosting to frost the top and
        outside of cake. Place cake into the fridge to chill for 30 minutes
        before serving.
