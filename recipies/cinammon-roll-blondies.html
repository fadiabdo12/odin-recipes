    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Filling</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1/4 cup light brown sugar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Blondies</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly</li>
      <li>3/4 cup white sugar</li>
      <li>1/4 cup light brown sugar</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
      <li>3/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
      <li>1 large egg, at room temperature</li>
      <li>1 large egg yolk</li>
      <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Glaze</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 ounce full fat cream cheese, at room temperature</li>
      <li>7 tablespoons confectioner's sugar, or as needed</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 pinch salt</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons heavy cream, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line an 8x8-inch
        square pan with enough parchment paper to have overhang on all sides.
      </li>
      <li>
        For filling: in a small bowl, mix brown sugar and cinnamon together
        until thoroughly combined. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        For blondies: Whisk melted butter, white sugar, brown sugar, vanilla,
        salt, and nutmeg until thoroughly combined. Add in egg and egg yolk and
        mix until thoroughly combined. Add in flour and baking soda and mix
        until just incorporated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread half the batter into an even layer in the prepared pan (it will
        be a somewhat thin layer). Sprinkle cinnamon-sugar mixture evenly over
        the batter. Place dollops of remaining batter over the cinnamon-sugar
        layer, and carefully spread into an even layer to cover cinnamon-sugar
        completely.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until bars begin to pull away from the sides
        of the pan, are puffed in the middle, and golden brown on top, 25 to 30
        minutes. Allow bars to cool completely in the pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        For glaze: beat cream cheese, powdered sugar, vanilla and salt together
        with an electric mixer until completely smooth. Add in heavy cream and
        beat until smooth. If glaze is too thick, add more heavy cream a small
        amount at a time; if glaze is too thin, add more powdered sugar until
        desired consistency is reached.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour glaze onto cooled bars and spread into an even layer. Cut into 16
        bars.
      </li>
    </ol>
