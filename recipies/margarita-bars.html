    <h2>Discription</h2>
    <p>
      These margarita bars are perfectly sweet, and oh, so creamy. The filling
      is like a cross between Key lime pie and a lemon bar, with a hint of
      tequila.

        <li>3/4 cup fresh lime juice</li>
        <li>1/4 cup blanco tequila</li>
        <li>
          2 tablespoons orange liqueur (such as Grand Marnier®, Triple Sec®, or

      </ul>
    </div>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 9-inch square
        baking pan with aluminum foil, leaving a 2-inch overhang on all sides.
        Lightly coat with cooking spray; set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir together graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, sugar, and 1/4
        teaspoon of the salt in a bowl until fully combined and resembles wet
        sand. Transfer to prepared baking pan, and firmly press into an even
        layer on bottom of pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until just golden brown and fragrant, 8 to 10
        minutes. Remove from oven, and let cool slightly, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk together yolks, condensed milk, lime zest and juice, and remaining
        1/2 teaspoon salt in a large bowl until smooth. Add tequila and orange
        liqueur, and whisk until fully combined, about 30 seconds. Pour over
        slightly cooled crust.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until edges are set and center has a slight
        jiggle, 25 to 28 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from oven; let cool to room temperature in pan on wire rack,
        about 1 hour. Place in freezer, uncovered, until chilled and set, at
        least 2 hours or up to 12 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using excess foil as handles, remove bars from pan, transfer to a
        cutting board; cut evenly into 16 bars, trimming edges, as desired.
        Garnish with flaky sea salt and additional lime zest. Serve.
      </li>
    </ol>
